humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.
Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
there's an online game where you pilot a mech against other mechs my friend plays
i can't remember what it's called but it probably has mech in the title
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

New games. I lol'd.




1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
They released a steam version of KaM (pic related)

But I remember when you had more than 255 of anything the game would go berserk.
Does anybody know if they fixed it in the new version?

Also KaM thread i guess
Sausage and brad mass production simulator


It's like you hate your serfs.

Anyway is there anything different compared to the actual game discs I own? any bugfixes, new features etc?
idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.


So nerds are autists and geeks are corporate shills.




I describe the feel of my throbbing cock and tell them how much I want to suck on their dicks everyday.
Get on my level.

No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...

Thank God I'm getting the German version.



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.

Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Hahahaha good one bro.
PS3 has no games XD
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]



Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Man, i wish i could leave this awful place.

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?
are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.

Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...

why



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it






Yeah, nah, I won't fall for that b8

military production + economy

How dumb are you ? He said by comparison faggot.
The idea isn't to give them superpowers.

Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.
Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.
They released a steam version of KaM (pic related)

But I remember when you had more than 255 of anything the game would go berserk.
Does anybody know if they fixed it in the new version?

Also KaM thread i guess
Sausage and brad mass production simulator


It's like you hate your serfs.

Anyway is there anything different compared to the actual game discs I own? any bugfixes, new features etc?
idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.
Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Hahahaha good one bro.
PS3 has no games XD
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]



Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Man, i wish i could leave this awful place.

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?

Alright. prove me wrong.

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually
are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?
why



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it


Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.
They released a steam version of KaM (pic related)

But I remember when you had more than 255 of anything the game would go berserk.
Does anybody know if they fixed it in the new version?

Also KaM thread i guess
Sausage and brad mass production simulator


It's like you hate your serfs.

Anyway is there anything different compared to the actual game discs I own? any bugfixes, new features etc?
idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

Well I don't see how that is like II.5

II.5 is just like FF games doing X-2 or XIII-2.
Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?


No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?




military production + economy

How dumb are you ? He said by comparison faggot.
The idea isn't to give them superpowers.

Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Alright. prove me wrong.

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually
are there any games where you get to fight god?

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?
why



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it


Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.
They released a steam version of KaM (pic related)

But I remember when you had more than 255 of anything the game would go berserk.
Does anybody know if they fixed it in the new version?

Also KaM thread i guess
Sausage and brad mass production simulator


It's like you hate your serfs.

Anyway is there anything different compared to the actual game discs I own? any bugfixes, new features etc?
idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

Well I don't see how that is like II.5

II.5 is just like FF games doing X-2 or XIII-2.
Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?


No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?




military production + economy

How dumb are you ? He said by comparison faggot.
The idea isn't to give them superpowers.

Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Alright. prove me wrong.

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually
are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.
They released a steam version of KaM (pic related)

But I remember when you had more than 255 of anything the game would go berserk.
Does anybody know if they fixed it in the new version?

Also KaM thread i guess
Sausage and brad mass production simulator


It's like you hate your serfs.

Anyway is there anything different compared to the actual game discs I own? any bugfixes, new features etc?
idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

Well I don't see how that is like II.5

II.5 is just like FF games doing X-2 or XIII-2.
Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?
OH THE RHYTHM OF MY HEART

IS BEATING LIKE A DRUM

NO, NEVER WILL I ROAM, FOR I KNOW MY PLACE IS HOME

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?


No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?




military production + economy

How dumb are you ? He said by comparison faggot.
The idea isn't to give them superpowers.

Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Alright. prove me wrong.

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually
are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?
why



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.

idk, OP

go get 256 of something and tell us

some guys are rebuilding the whole engine of the game to work with modern PC's

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?


No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?




military production + economy

How dumb are you ? He said by comparison faggot.
The idea isn't to give them superpowers.

Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Alright. prove me wrong.

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually
are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?
why



SO you havn't actually played XY?

Because those caps in OP's pic are literally the only three instances in the entire game ,and they are all from random trainers whose text you could have missed and not read anyway.

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it


Why the fuck isn't there a beat em up game similar to Megas XLR and Pacific Rim where you pilot a giant Mecha and beat the shit out of Kaiju and other Giant Mecha?
Pacific Rim sucked ass.

Too many dialogue.
Not enough attention given to other mechas.
Too bloopers up the ass.

Go back to /tv/, we are talking about video games, take your shitty opinions elsewhere.
I just want more games that use this thing.

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

What is 'post-modernism'?



Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me

wouldn't pay money for half assed steam shit


W-What a-a-are you?

im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

I forgot my steamid: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spielk

Well I don't see how that is like II.5

II.5 is just like FF games doing X-2 or XIII-2.
Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?
OH THE RHYTHM OF MY HEART

IS BEATING LIKE A DRUM

WITH THE WORDS "I LOVE YOU" ROLLING OFF MY TONGUE

NO, NEVER WILL I ROAM, FOR I KNOW MY PLACE IS HOME

WHERE THE OCEAN MEETS THE SKY, I'LL BE SAILIN'


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.
How can one company be so based?

Is this game set in the 80s?

I saw an advert for a "Mongoose" film on a bus stop in the demo.

I really hate this neo 80s bullshit

Why?

hahahahaha

dont fucking lie to me, if you said you'd pirated it i'd have uploaded the crackfix for you, but i won't now, you lying sack of feces.
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?
Now that Vivendi is no longer in controlBlizzard, you think that WoW might become good again?
no

why

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off
HOW DO YOU FUCKING COUNTER THIS FUCKING CUNT?
WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

That looks likes the map from the new game that is supposed to be even more casual than LoL.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

What is 'post-modernism'?



Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?


No, no we don't.
No thank you.
Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts







Why exactly do you all care about this? i've seen tons of threads already sure >50gb for a COD game
Its not like your actually gonna get the game? or are you?

That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs

are there any games where you get to fight god?

okay let us ask again
Is there any game where you can fight god?
end of story

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Xbox as in original Xbox.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

working as a team fucking sucks

All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.

dont fucking lie to me, if you said you'd pirated it i'd have uploaded the crackfix for you, but i won't now, you lying sack of feces.
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?
Now that Vivendi is no longer in controlBlizzard, you think that WoW might become good again?
no




im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Fuck off
HOW DO YOU FUCKING COUNTER THIS FUCKING CUNT?
WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?


lmao

That looks likes the map from the new game that is supposed to be even more casual than LoL.
Can't recall the name of the game though.

He breaks the mana inside his body to move quickly between two points. He's a monk, not a spellcaster.


change that to "was"


Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

What is 'post-modernism'?



Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?
Now that Vivendi is no longer in controlBlizzard, you think that WoW might become good again?
no

why

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.

It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.

dont fucking lie to me, if you said you'd pirated it i'd have uploaded the crackfix for you, but i won't now, you lying sack of feces.
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?
Now that Vivendi is no longer in controlBlizzard, you think that WoW might become good again?
no

why

Only poor vitafags and mustardfats havent played yet.

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off
HOW DO YOU FUCKING COUNTER THIS FUCKING CUNT?
WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

That looks likes the map from the new game that is supposed to be even more casual than LoL.
Can't recall the name of the game though.

He breaks the mana inside his body to move quickly between two points. He's a monk, not a spellcaster.


change that to "was"


Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Just because your parents provide for you for free does not mean other people are like that, you know.


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?
I trust that guy called Topofarmer.

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

What is 'post-modernism'?



Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?

They're actually removing quickscoping for the next game. I can't wait to see the butthurt.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Besides airport music, random ambient, sucks

Some unmelodyness electric mess, even main theme was bad

Not a single good song, P2 got better songs, also singing cubes were neat.

From other games I played can see it on the list (but probably with different order)

Four Lions

Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...

2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.


console babbies rekt again
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious

i think they are retarded but they allow me to make my faggot to look extra faggy

Four Lions
a 2deep4u comedy on muslims in the UK







Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner


im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.

They're actually removing quickscoping for the next game. I can't wait to see the butthurt.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?

All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

a 2deep4u comedy on muslims in the UK







Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner


im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.
Discuss.

They're actually removing quickscoping for the next game. I can't wait to see the butthurt.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Man, i wish i could leave this awful place.

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious
god damn have to vent

am i the only one who thinks these screencaps are fucking retarded

i think they are retarded but they allow me to make my faggot to look extra faggy

kinda like in real life?

Does anyone else find it to be a huge turn off when an attractive grill plays vidya or watches anime?
I usually lose all my interest in them if that happens.
I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

Not a single good song, P2 got better songs, also singing cubes were neat.

From other games I played can see it on the list (but probably with different order)
gtavc, mgs, thps3, gta sa, max, mafia, hitman, max2, me.

I can' say anything about rest, didn't play.

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.
here it is, lol
http://www.kickstarter com/projects/technicalillusions/cas


I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.




Fag.

Not yet anon.


How can one company be so based?

Deal with it, nerd.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...

Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.

a 2deep4u comedy on muslims in the UK







Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner


im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.
Discuss.

They're actually removing quickscoping for the next game. I can't wait to see the butthurt.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.
here it is, lol
http://www.kickstarter com/projects/technicalillusions/cas


I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.




Fag.

Not yet anon.


How can one company be so based?


More like



Telltale


Deal with it, nerd.

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle




This list sucks, you should all feel bad.


WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.
http://www.theguardian.com/technolo

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.


console babbies rekt again
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious
god damn have to vent

and had this awesome plan

and strap a remote bomb under the hood











am i the only one who thinks these screencaps are fucking retarded

i think they are retarded but they allow me to make my faggot to look extra faggy

kinda like in real life?

Max payne3
Besides airport music, random ambient, sucks
Deus ex
Some unmelodyness electric mess, even main theme was bad
Portal
Not a single good song, P2 got better songs, also singing cubes were neat.

From other games I played can see it on the list (but probably with different order)
gtavc, mgs, thps3, gta sa, max, mafia, hitman, max2, me.

I can' say anything about rest, didn't play.

I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.

Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

Why would it matter?
There's no talent left at Capcom
Itsuno and his team are stuck on iOS shit too.

It's dead.



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious
god damn have to vent

Four Lions
a 2deep4u comedy on muslims in the UK







Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner


im sure they would be even more offended if they did that




They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
why

This is fucking funny. hahaha

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.
Is it hacked yet?
I was told it would be hacked... Why does nobody have an answer?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.
Discuss.

They're actually removing quickscoping for the next game. I can't wait to see the butthurt.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.




Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

see


I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

Can you believe people put up with this kinda shit nowadays? I remember back when i played pokémon we had good designs. How do people think that these modern designs are "good"?
All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?

Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.

Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.


console babbies rekt again
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious
god damn have to vent

Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.







They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle




This list sucks, you should all feel bad.


WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...



humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.



bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?
Marty.

Asuka is best waifu


Tenchi is an idiot for constantly turning her down

Reach
I will give you the honor of carrying me!
However... i won't leave until i find the thing i'm looking for!
You'd better believe me!


What the fuck?


stop naruto STOP

i don't want to believe anymore






now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts








That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.
http://www.gamespot.com/articles/li

Why? Why are they so obsessed with this thoroughly mediocre character?

I love her saga and I'm sad to see it end.

armpits.

Toriyama pls go
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

see


I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Can you believe people put up with this kinda shit nowadays? I remember back when i played pokémon we had good designs. How do people think that these modern designs are "good"?
All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

1/10 somebody will respond
you mean when sugimori didn't even have a style of his own and was still in his phase where he copied toriyama?
ok

anyways, all gens have their ups and downs in pokemon design
0/10. Get some new material OP.


Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you.

It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle




This list sucks, you should all feel bad.


WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Neither was I.

I get you're trying to argue with a few different people right now, so understandably you're a bit flustered.
I said that studying the theme was a shallow way of determining the quality of a film overall. Not that studying themes was shallow in general.


It's the only point you've raised as a negative to Blade Runner so I wasn't assuming anything.


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

1. GTAV isn't on PC
2. Consolefags didn't said GTAV is bad it's just PC fags who suddenly like it.





:^^)
I have a console and didn't bother getting this game for it. When it comes out on PC, however, I might consider.
Might.
Itll be like always. itll come to PC, mustard will boast they have it, they dont like the game/play it much but will still boast about it having it.

Also, Red Dead Redmeption was miles better than GTAV. That is a game I would like to see on PC for mods to contribute to instead of this shit, GTAV just feels so lifeless I dont know what it is.


console babbies rekt again
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?



That\s pretty hard way of saying "I've made it up"

This. Mikami, Kamiya, Inafune of all people are all gone from capcom. Sad days for anyone who gives a shit about franchises in Capcom's possession.
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

at least the cutscenes are different, it's funny how Lamar brings a flower and hits on you when he comes to pick you up from the airport. and Trevor declaring his love for you is hillairious
god damn have to vent

i think they are retarded but they allow me to make my faggot to look extra faggy

Sometimes it's fun to go on a mindless rampage of kiddies that are shit at videogames.

I've made many starting out Minecraft servers on /v/ fall apart before they really get going by gaining the little communities trust, setting fire to things, and slipping away and destroying the flint and steel before the flames get discovered.

It's not that I'm destroying things, because often the admin just rolls the server back to before the fire started or goes creative to rebuild it, however he wants to deal with it. What matters is I get the community to start arguing with each other, blaming each other, pointing fingers and eventually falling apart and quitting, until the admin just quits and closes the server. It's fascinating ow people pick up on different things and consider them as evidence, the ways they decide on blaming each other. If I didn't know it was me, I would have been convinced by some of the ways they figured who was the fire starter.

Didn't get 1.5 remix but I'll probably get this just for Birth By Sleep. Been meaning to play that for eons anyway.




MY BODY ISNT READY

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.
I will give you the honor of carrying me!
However... i won't leave until i find the thing i'm looking for!
You'd better believe me!


What the fuck?

i don't want to believe anymore

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

see


I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Can you believe people put up with this kinda shit nowadays? I remember back when i played pokémon we had good designs. How do people think that these modern designs are "good"?
All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

you mean when sugimori didn't even have a style of his own and was still in his phase where he copied toriyama?
ok

anyways, all gens have their ups and downs in pokemon design

Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.

It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle




This list sucks, you should all feel bad.


WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.
I will give you the honor of carrying me!
However... i won't leave until i find the thing i'm looking for!
You'd better believe me!


What the fuck?


stop naruto STOP

i don't want to believe anymore






now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts








That's 2$ per GB.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.
http://www.gamespot.com/articles/li

Why? Why are they so obsessed with this thoroughly mediocre character?

I love her saga and I'm sad to see it end.

armpits.

Toriyama pls go
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

see


I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Can you believe people put up with this kinda shit nowadays? I remember back when i played pokémon we had good designs. How do people think that these modern designs are "good"?
All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

1/10 somebody will respond
you mean when sugimori didn't even have a style of his own and was still in his phase where he copied toriyama?
ok

anyways, all gens have their ups and downs in pokemon design
0/10. Get some new material OP.


Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




Dont call names anon, thats offensive
humans use dogs and cows, right? that should be our 'thing'. we have animals we've submitted. other species for various reasons have not.

Intelligence and strength.







They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
Post your homes, I'll start off

Np

We've already discussed this, pls go
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story





They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

Videogame picture thread. Post vidya pictures, make sure your posts have a bit of content. If itlike a bad idea to have one of these threads, that's fine. Just don't shit it up for the rest of us.





Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
Post your homes, I'll start off

Np

We've already discussed this, pls go
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?

But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

1/10 somebody will respond
you mean when sugimori didn't even have a style of his own and was still in his phase where he copied toriyama?
ok

anyways, all gens have their ups and downs in pokemon design
0/10. Get some new material OP.


Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary




He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
It isn't out yet. I'm replaying P4A, though until P4A2 is released.

It's one of the optional things that you can buy, but isn't enabled in the game.
Streamer managed to hack it out to see what was there.
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

I had a GF that always asked me to play Resident Evil while she played with my hair. Could hardly concentrate on the game cuz she was practically putting me to sleep with that shit. I didn't snap though...



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle




This list sucks, you should all feel bad.


WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.
why

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

This
Dark souls is a shit game
How is the Metal Gear Solid 1 PC port? Would I be better off emulating it?

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story





They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Oh cool, I can walljump.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.

Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Why are video game reviewers dis-honest?

Why are movie reviewers more honest and trust worthy?

Is it because movie companies don't pay reviewers like video game companies do?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

see


I think 7XL was more tedious. 8 is a bit worse because it has 77 characters and I don't like being forced to play as certain massive fucking faggots.
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Can you believe people put up with this kinda shit nowadays? I remember back when i played pokémon we had good designs. How do people think that these modern designs are "good"?
All gens had good pokemons and terrible pokemons

1/10 somebody will respond
you mean when sugimori didn't even have a style of his own and was still in his phase where he copied toriyama?
ok

anyways, all gens have their ups and downs in pokemon design
0/10. Get some new material OP.


Why?
I didnt like it either, OP

but I can see why the new generation of entitled, immature gamurz would like a game like that..


A hipster grooving and destroying a city, the game.


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Please stop, nobody cares about your shitty Film Studies degree or your terrible opinions.


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story





They fuck more women than you, /v/.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.
rate my fag
why

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.
Post your homes, I'll start off

We've already discussed this, pls go
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been
ITT: Bad Ports

probably best example ever

Dark souls is a shit game
How is the Metal Gear Solid 1 PC port? Would I be better off emulating it?

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.




He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.
Videogame picture thread. Post vidya pictures, make sure your posts have a bit of content. If itlike a bad idea to have one of these threads, that's fine. Just don't shit it up for the rest of us.






I'd like to see you do this.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?

Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.

Not with the composite cables I have

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?

Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?
Marty.

Asuka is best waifu


Tenchi is an idiot for constantly turning her down

Reach
I will give you the honor of carrying me!
However... i won't leave until i find the thing i'm looking for!
You'd better believe me!


What the fuck?


stop naruto STOP

i don't want to believe anymore






Post your homes, I'll start off
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.
why

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.
ITT: Bad Ports

probably best example ever

gawd i'd hate to be the atari owned who get suckered into that one. Even coming from the arcade to the 2600 you expect a certain level of degradation going down but this huh...practically unplayable

did you tried to disable AA ingame?

This
Dark souls is a shit game
How is the Metal Gear Solid 1 PC port? Would I be better off emulating it?

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.




He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.
Videogame picture thread. Post vidya pictures, make sure your posts have a bit of content. If itlike a bad idea to have one of these threads, that's fine. Just don't shit it up for the rest of us.






I'd like to see you do this.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?

Asuka is best waifu


Tenchi is an idiot for constantly turning her down

I will give you the honor of carrying me!
However... i won't leave until i find the thing i'm looking for!
You'd better believe me!


What the fuck?


stop naruto STOP

i don't want to believe anymore






Post your homes, I'll start off
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.
why

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.
ITT: Bad Ports

probably best example ever

gawd i'd hate to be the atari owned who get suckered into that one. Even coming from the arcade to the 2600 you expect a certain level of degradation going down but this huh...practically unplayable

did you tried to disable AA ingame?

This
Dark souls is a shit game
How is the Metal Gear Solid 1 PC port? Would I be better off emulating it?

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.




He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.
Videogame picture thread. Post vidya pictures, make sure your posts have a bit of content. If itlike a bad idea to have one of these threads, that's fine. Just don't shit it up for the rest of us.






I'd like to see you do this.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.

Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?
Are the dmc 3 and 4 bundle worth the sale?
I only did those games on consoles. Are PC versions any good?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

The difference being that if you use a 2000 year old medical book as a guide for surgery, you can fuck up your body.

If you use a 2000 year old mythological book as a guide for finding meaning in a world where there is none, you can't fuck up the soul you don't have.

Religion can be compared to videogames. Dangerous if you take it TOO seriously, but can be a worthwhile experience of recreation in a purely physical world. Get over it, everyone. Why bother arguing?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

Even when discerning, there's always the heavy bias from /v/, and any straight reviews get drowned out. I can only say that you get the edges of the portrait, and that everything as you get closer to the center is just an extra layer of bullshit /v/ put on it, especially if they don't like the game. For other games, there is only rhetoric.

The board in general's like an angry catty girl in the frequent times it's not being matter of fact.

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?


Why aren't you moralfags mad about that? Why don't you do something about that?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

Why don't you fucking Google it? This isn't a philosophy board.

this is a non-video-game board, good enough for me



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Yeah, you haven't played any of those games you listed


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

Post your homes, I'll start off
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.
why

I don't get it





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

How can one company be so based?

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.



are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?
Post your homes, I'll start off
Oh cool, I can walljump.

Don't need rope for my long mineshaft, now to find caves.


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.
why





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.
How can one company be so based?

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.



are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time.

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.
why





Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.
How can one company be so based?

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.



He probably wanted to know what his mom said then so he can fantasize, where do you think we are?

Why is that, anon?

I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.



are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

no thanks


you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.
ITT: Bad Ports

probably best example ever

gawd i'd hate to be the atari owned who get suckered into that one. Even coming from the arcade to the 2600 you expect a certain level of degradation going down but this huh...practically unplayable

This
Dark souls is a shit game
How is the Metal Gear Solid 1 PC port? Would I be better off emulating it?

You would yes, only because it wont support modern resolutions.
Videogame picture thread. Post vidya pictures, make sure your posts have a bit of content. If itlike a bad idea to have one of these threads, that's fine. Just don't shit it up for the rest of us.






I'd like to see you do this.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
so where does haze get all of his disposable income from?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.


Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary

I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.






I couldn't remember her name, but I found her odly similar
Post your homes, I'll start off


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

Have any of you tried out Audiosurf 2? Or is it too /mu/ for /v/

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.

Is it hacked yet?

Not with the composite cables I have

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

I hate how people idealize chess as being the epitome of strategy games. It's really shallow and slow compared to most videogames.



Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

So it's easier to tell that magenta area is meant to be one shade of gray instead of a slightly different shade of grade, I guess.

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

Have any of you tried out Audiosurf 2? Or is it too /mu/ for /v/

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.
Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.
why



Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

I hate how people idealize chess as being the epitome of strategy games. It's really shallow and slow compared to most videogames.



Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.
Also, it that doesn't explain the fact that there are very close shades of blue on the costume. Yet they decided not to use the place holding colors for the differing blues.

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.

That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October

if they fixed the horrible ps3 port its pretty good. if not play the xbox version or wait untill 31 oct for pc release
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

News at 10: Faggot proclaims a point and click adventure game is not an actual video game.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference
I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.

Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary


It was in the coming soon list and it's not there anymore.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?




Sherlock Holmes he is not.

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.
why



Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

ENEMY


I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.






I couldn't remember her name, but I found her odly similar
Post your homes, I'll start off


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

Have any of you tried out Audiosurf 2? Or is it too /mu/ for /v/

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time. He'd hold you down and rape you repeatedly filling you over and over with autistsperm.


Post yo rides

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Do YOU even read?





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?
This is cool and more likely to happen than any rival tech. Bls consider. (´･ω･`)

There are fucking 3 threads for this shit.

She got fired from valve. not laid off, fired. why should I trust any of this shit. It will probably look like ass, monocolor rasters floating in 3d space.
Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!

It depends on the map really. Boneyard I sit on top of the building across from the plane. Sandy Shores I sit on the 711 like building in the corner. Haven't found a good spot in the other map since it never seems to come up.

You NEED at least one other person to play. Preferably a friend or two that are competant, but randoms you can manage.

The best tip I can give you is to just pop out of cover quick and don't stay out shooting. The rooftops give you decent all around coverage and it's easy to see the enemies. The only thing that sucks is that helicopters fuck you up easier so take them down quick. Only run out for Armor, weapons, health, and ammo once it tells you to take out the last guy. That way you have time to kill him and already be near what you want when it respawns between rounds.

Don't be angry if you fail. You make pretty good money as long as you make it more than halfway and you get lots of Shooting experience/RP. Make it through 10 and you get 20k which isn't too hard with a decent team.

The only downside is it is time consuming. Better than redoing the same mission for 2k with randoms.



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.
are there any games where you get to fight god?

I liked the lore regarding Pawns, the Dragon and the Duke. For some reason there aren't many games dealing with the concept of immortality, which is strange given that it is the oldest story in the world.

XenoGears


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3
Reminder /v/ when she gets in this pose, it's time for the pimphand.

If I could play one game for the rest of my life, this is it.

Speaking of Assault Horizon - is it that bad? I am thinking of trying it out since it's the only AC game that I can get on PC (my rig is not good for PS2 emulation), is this game okay if you don't compare it to previous ones?

It's kind of acceptable. The chopper missions were fucking boring though.

I recommend pirating.

What else would you call it? Didn't think that one through did ya buddy?

Image being a cute little loli constantly getting groped and raped by your Down's autistic brother with retard strength, barging in while you're taking a bath or a shower or when you're sleeping, basically any time he is horny which is all the time.

Won't you just get that "bad-play" stamp on you by doing that?

great observation i'll give you a 100/10
why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.

TWAU is on all consoles bro.

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

I hate how people idealize chess as being the epitome of strategy games. It's really shallow and slow compared to most videogames.



Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.
BACK TO BACK

So it's easier to tell that magenta area is meant to be one shade of gray instead of a slightly different shade of grade, I guess.
Because not everybody involved is going to be look at these through a computer.
New locktest when ?

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.
Also, it that doesn't explain the fact that there are very close shades of blue on the costume. Yet they decided not to use the place holding colors for the differing blues.


What tipped you off?

Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty silly about that.
Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary


It was in the coming soon list and it's not there anymore.
why



Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

ENEMY


I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.






I couldn't remember her name, but I found her odly similar
Post your homes, I'll start off


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

First you log into e-hentai, THEN you clean the cookie, THEN you do a hard refresh you dumbfuck.
I'm a little girl with a benis

Ask me anything
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

I hate how people idealize chess as being the epitome of strategy games. It's really shallow and slow compared to most videogames.



Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.
BACK TO BACK

So it's easier to tell that magenta area is meant to be one shade of gray instead of a slightly different shade of grade, I guess.
Because not everybody involved is going to be look at these through a computer.
New locktest when ?

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.
Also, it that doesn't explain the fact that there are very close shades of blue on the costume. Yet they decided not to use the place holding colors for the differing blues.


What tipped you off?

Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty silly about that.
Is this /v/ approved?

Looking for a spooky yet comfy game for October
This was removed from Steam.

Anyone know why?

it hasn't been even released yet.
If anything, the Greenlight went through and they're now actually doing finishing touches

Odd, it was there this morning. It's probably gonna re-appear in a few hours with a preorder button
It's not even that scary


It was in the coming soon list and it's not there anymore.
why



Fuck off

I played through BL2 twice and only ever saw one meme, although it repeated. /v/ completely overblew the memes in BL2.


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

ENEMY


I'd jerk off to this artstyle

Right now, I just want to voice chat with someone.






I couldn't remember her name, but I found her odly similar
Post your homes, I'll start off


But is it? I'm curious as to what to get so I can do silly things, this or the 3d version. I'm not the guy who calls people autist.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

Have any of you tried out Audiosurf 2? Or is it too /mu/ for /v/

you don't get fired for downsizing, anon.
Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.
Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?
This is cool and more likely to happen than any rival tech. Bls consider. (´･ω･`)

We're just a few years away from playing holo-chess!
There are fucking 3 threads for this shit.

She got fired from valve. not laid off, fired. why should I trust any of this shit. It will probably look like ass, monocolor rasters floating in 3d space.
Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished
How can one company be so based?

Why do you play movies?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?







Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?

There are fucking 3 threads for this shit.

She got fired from valve. not laid off, fired. why should I trust any of this shit. It will probably look like ass, monocolor rasters floating in 3d space.
Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".


He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.

WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

So it's easier to tell that magenta area is meant to be one shade of gray instead of a slightly different shade of grade, I guess.
Because not everybody involved is going to be look at these through a computer.
New locktest when ?

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.
Also, it that doesn't explain the fact that there are very close shades of blue on the costume. Yet they decided not to use the place holding colors for the differing blues.


What tipped you off?

Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty silly about that.

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Yes it has.

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist.

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?







Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.

Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty silly about that.


He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.






bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.



wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

it's the only good game ever made, so yes

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.

Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?
This is cool and more likely to happen than any rival tech. Bls consider. (´･ω･`)

We're just a few years away from playing holo-chess!
There are fucking 3 threads for this shit.

She got fired from valve. not laid off, fired. why should I trust any of this shit. It will probably look like ass, monocolor rasters floating in 3d space.
Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...





What's the problem? I'd get it if it was some sort of game like WoW but it's just something that everyone's going to casually play for 3-4 months and then forget about.


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Yes it has.

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

DMC3 on PC requires modding to work, even then it's a shitty PC port.

DMC4 on PC is god tier.

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that
OFFICIAL /v/ SOUNDTRACK NOSTALGIA THREAD

My addition will be in the first reply

This soundtrack really takes me back

BACK TO BACK

So it's easier to tell that magenta area is meant to be one shade of gray instead of a slightly different shade of grade, I guess.
Because not everybody involved is going to be look at these through a computer.
New locktest when ?

While that's a plausible reason, it doesn't sound like you're so sure. Sounds like you're guessing.
Also, it that doesn't explain the fact that there are very close shades of blue on the costume. Yet they decided not to use the place holding colors for the differing blues.


What tipped you off?

Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty silly about that.




bait? what are you talking about


Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.



Fuck sake man.



wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

It is my hobby to upset autists.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

God damn.

I think I get it now. You guys make douchey looking character deliberately, so I'll get mad when you run me down coming out of my garage and drive off thinking you're hot shit whilst never wanting to one on one.

Or inevitably hiding in your apartment when you've got a bounty.

It all makes sense now.






It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

:(




More like memorizing responses.
I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.




Why?


it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?
How can one company be so based?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?







Jesus christ how horrifying

I wouldn't mind this.


It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Yeah nah, I'm not supporting the over saturation of the market.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.

Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?

There are fucking 3 threads for this shit.

She got fired from valve. not laid off, fired. why should I trust any of this shit. It will probably look like ass, monocolor rasters floating in 3d space.
Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".




Jet Set Radio HD did that.
It's actually pretty good to see how many people didn't even launch the game.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

I think I get it now. You guys make douchey looking character deliberately, so I'll get mad when you run me down coming out of my garage and drive off thinking you're hot shit whilst never wanting to one on one.

It all makes sense now.

He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.


How can one company be so based?

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.
why


But that's wrong.

It has memes in literally ever NPC dialogue, just like BL2 had memes LITERALLY every 2 seconds.

You forgot about people who aren't manchildren.

Western release fucking when?


They look so stupid and I want to play them
Right after Yakuza 5 and Fatal Frame 4.



mmmm

FF4 got a fantranslation so no bother there. But don't remind me of goddamn Yakuza 5.


Assuming you want to mod your wii and risk bricking it/have a bangin PC to emulate it.
Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

Holy shit, She's just Ma-Ma from Dredd.



Ew
Why is it so hard for western artists to not draw a manface on every girl?

TIme to fap.




Jet Set Radio HD did that.
It's actually pretty good to see how many people didn't even launch the game.


I like you, Persona 4 Arena. But I'll be damned if that didn't disgust me.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.


Why?

it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.
Motorcycles are the best form of transportation.

and had this awesome plan

and strap a remote bomb under the hood











am i the only one who thinks these screencaps are fucking retarded

i think they are retarded but they allow me to make my faggot to look extra faggy

kinda like in real life?

Can you do duckface in GTAV?






Fuck sake man.



wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.


+1 feat



The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

God damn.

I think I get it now. You guys make douchey looking character deliberately, so I'll get mad when you run me down coming out of my garage and drive off thinking you're hot shit whilst never wanting to one on one.

Or inevitably hiding in your apartment when you've got a bounty.

It all makes sense now.






It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

:(




More like memorizing responses.
I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit

Yeah, they are still super fast and strong, because the rest are a bunch of pussies. Not fun.

Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.

Ignore the sloppiness and set sail for disappointment.

First row revealed soon.


Normally, I'd pick B, but I have a good feeling about D.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?
How can one company be so based?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

You have to be autistic to not recognize and obvious spic.

God damn.

I think I get it now. You guys make douchey looking character deliberately, so I'll get mad when you run me down coming out of my garage and drive off thinking you're hot shit whilst never wanting to one on one.

Or inevitably hiding in your apartment when you've got a bounty.

It all makes sense now.






It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

More like memorizing responses.
I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.






Jet Set Radio HD did that.
It's actually pretty good to see how many people didn't even launch the game.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.
How can one company be so based?

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster


Why?

it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Normally, I'd pick B, but I have a good feeling about D.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Nice little strawman you pulled out of nowhere anon. This can't be your first, you seem far too experienced. I mean, you managed to construct an entire strawman with absolutely no base material, and that's impressive!

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Pretty much this

Live and Reloaded's multiplayer was still fund but it tried so bad to be like Halo's or other multiplayers at the time, which is fine but in the end coems out as inferior when said games are aviable to you.

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?
How can one company be so based?


TWAU is on all consoles bro.

Beyond is shit, there's no gameplay, its a movie. If you fuck up on the quicktime there's on game overs because according to the guy who made beyond, "Game over screens are a failure by the developer"

At least you can fuck up and die in AWAU

But hey, blaim it on something that doesn't matter if it helps.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.






Jet Set Radio HD did that.
It's actually pretty good to see how many people didn't even launch the game.

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Why?

it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.

Pathetic.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.

It emphasizes strong fundamentals and planning. If you want something with a little more flash play


It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

How can one company be so based?

Basically this.

I hated Beyond, TLoU, Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain

I liked TWD and I absolutely love TWAU




yeah, there's a difference

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Why?

it's the only good game ever made, so yes

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.

Fuck sake man.



wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

He was clearly talking about the dragon stone from Skyrim, and the mechanic I just explained is true within that game.




main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I live in a big city and most of them like to do the same thing and wear the same clothes and fit in.
And it's a normal thing dude, it's called social intelligence.
You shouldn't be too angry about it.

Can't you have a talk like a civilized person without thinking is bait?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

nice you look like richard stallman you fucking loser
Are you sailing the Great Sea with your Waifu /v/?


The game is shit and it looks even shittier, You didn't finish it on gamecube despite being even more childish than you currently are, and that's because it's yet another boring ass "tap X to finish conversation in 9 minutes" and nintendo thought "well of course the only way to follow that up is a thirty second puzzle a toddler could solve, and then maybe we can sum up the room with a twenty minute conversation."

And these fucking nintendo babbies just lick it up.

What a valuable opinion which I'm sure will change a lot of people's minds about this game.



What a well defined argument in opposition to the paragraph of points I made. Thank you for outright admitting that you and everyone like you will immediately ignore the content of a post when you feel insulted.

Stop fucking trying to pretend you have what it takes to discuss anything other than how hurt your feelings are.

And other wasn't even made by Nintendo. That movie license shit made by "this is just my job" -guys can be found on all consoles.


No video or camera's were allowed.

It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

Tsubaki when?

on second thought, google has no idea what I'm talking about when I ask about the big feet thing, so maybe that guy was full of shit.

but yeah, if you look at the original characters, it fits with all of THEM.
and they even got away from that style when they did Elena, but I guess they went back when they turned the sprites into 3d models.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.



Shit nigger u mad jelly of Nomura's beltz and zippers.
I have only enjoyed this game in the last year, maybe. Am I stuck in the past?


Alright, thanks, is there any installation guide or just the order where you install those mods?

Maybe.
It's a cool game, tho

Posts like yours make me cringe like hell.
Don't you think it's embarrassing to act like a faggot on youtube?







You can install the widescreen mod before trilogy or after, doesn't matter. As for other mods, check the readme.

I think I get it now. You guys make douchey looking character deliberately, so I'll get mad when you run me down coming out of my garage and drive off thinking you're hot shit whilst never wanting to one on one.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Why?

How did you know?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

it's a problem with the crack, there's a crackfix, but it's nearly impossible to find.
i have it, but you don't deserve it now.
Most attractive fighting game character.

and then you hear her English voice.

I keep expecting Axl Low to show up at some point, what with the nods to GG and the whole time shift fuckery.
Tsubaki when?

on second thought, google has no idea what I'm talking about when I ask about the big feet thing, so maybe that guy was full of shit.

but yeah, if you look at the original characters, it fits with all of THEM.
and they even got away from that style when they did Elena, but I guess they went back when they turned the sprites into 3d models.

Why the hell he's moving time machine anyway?
How can one company be so based?

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.
Western release fucking when?


They look so stupid and I want to play them
Right after Yakuza 5 and Fatal Frame 4.



mmmm

FF4 got a fantranslation so no bother there. But don't remind me of goddamn Yakuza 5.

Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.



Shit nigger u mad jelly of Nomura's beltz and zippers.
I have only enjoyed this game in the last year, maybe. Am I stuck in the past?


Alright, thanks, is there any installation guide or just the order where you install those mods?

Maybe.

Hey guys, How would you react if I told you that a new Devil May Cry game is in the works as I post this message?

PC version of 3 is dogshit but the PC version of 4 is the best version of the game.


DMC4 port is great.
DMC3's is, less than stellar to say the least...

3 NO.
4 YES
I played one of the old devil may cry games but it was boring and I hated it. I liked DMC so much better and I hope they are making a sequel to that

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.
Post your homes, I'll start off

Minecraft didn't invent block mining games.

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


It was a Disney expo, not a KH event, KH was just at the event.

It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.



Shit nigger u mad jelly of Nomura's beltz and zippers.
I have only enjoyed this game in the last year, maybe. Am I stuck in the past?


Alright, thanks, is there any installation guide or just the order where you install those mods?

Maybe.
It's a cool game, tho

Posts like yours make me cringe like hell.
Don't you think it's embarrassing to act like a faggot on youtube?







You can install the widescreen mod before trilogy or after, doesn't matter. As for other mods, check the readme.

Thanks a lot anon

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.

It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.

It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

:(




More like memorizing responses.
I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

I like that people are planning to compile it not realizing this is essentially /v/ incarnate and they're just mocking what they all are underneath.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?

There's nothing to get right, tattoos look like shit.






It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.


I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.




Fag.

Not yet anon.



Deal w/it




Nah, by 2050 we'll have our conciousnesses in computers, living in a perfect matrix.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?

Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD
Western Female Models General

Holy shit, She's just Ma-Ma from Dredd.



Ew
Why is it so hard for western artists to not draw a manface on every girl?

TIme to fap.

It's funny how this is the only arguments people can complain on when it comes to western style
Post your homes, I'll start off

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?

There's nothing to get right, tattoos look like shit.






It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

You do know there's a working PSP emulator now

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.
How can one company be so based?

The difference is that TWAU has an interesting and well written story and it has actually influencial choices.
Instead, Cage's cringeworthy and high schooler writing ruins Beyond

Also, the game gives you an illusion of freewill, because at the end, you always end up with an obligatory choice.

If Cage made good stories we'd call them games, too.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.

It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves.

It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

Post your homes, I'll start off

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

He found the Philosopher's Legacy.

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?

It's really not. It doesn't involve twitch but there is a lot of strategy involved. You can't play a strat through to the end. It's actually very similar to Starcraft in some ways in that there are chess openers/build orders essentially...and it's the same in that regardless of what you start out with, the game will change flow somewhere in the middle and you can't just stick to one strategy.

It's dissimilar in that it involves no twitch.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

So Xbox One?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.
Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Protip: You can't.

If only the pacing weren't so utterly terrible and it wasn't the most repetitive game ever made.


mfw noone says grimrock

i fucking

Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

So it's recorded and archived, eh?

CoD single player is my guilty pleasure. It's so cheesy it's good.

The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.


I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.

Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves.

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.

It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?
How can one company be so based?

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD
Western Female Models General

Holy shit, She's just Ma-Ma from Dredd.



Ew
Why is it so hard for western artists to not draw a manface on every girl?

TIme to fap.

It's funny how this is the only arguments people can complain on when it comes to western style
Post your homes, I'll start off

It's a 2D version of what Minecraft should have been

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-valve-

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

So it's recorded and archived, eh?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts








Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.

CoD single player is my guilty pleasure. It's so cheesy it's good.

Pirate always, of course.
The woman who stole Valve's Augmented Reality headset when she was fired from Valve has launched a Kickstarter for her Oculus Rift competitor.

And it looks like she's going to pocket the money.

People are free to spend their own money as they see fit, but it still makes me somewhat angry.


I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.

It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?

What exactly is worth replaying it? New missions? Can you masturbate in this version?


Who cares, I love reading books like Neuromancer in the train or wherever. I personally can't wait.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4t-

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.
Discuss.


I'm half way through the series at the moment. The movie is mostly the same but way more compressed.


no, it wouldn't

You.

I like you.
i dont want to rely more on teamwork

working as a team fucking sucks

Sublte.

Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
How the fuck do I kill Plantera? Is the only easy way to lure it to the surface?

I have turtle armor and have been dropping it to about 12k with light discs.
I never asked for this...

again? theyr'e always like this


artificial intelligence caused Old Night, therefor it is forbidden by the adeptus mechanicus

That's fucking fantastic. Reminds me of Kirkbride.


You've got to admire her ambition, despite the fact that the ambition is to spread her cover all forms of gaming with a thick plastic covering of political correctness.



The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

Who cares, I love reading books like Neuromancer in the train or wherever. I personally can't wait.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

i;ve never seen someone so fucking punchable before

I don't remember her accusing Valve of sexism.

I don't quite understand why they were working on a project like this. It has nothing to do with Valve's goals.

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

How can one company be so based?

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.

Shut up. Gabe gives you all the amazing sales on Steam and you have the nerve to talk shit about Vavle?

if you buy a kickstarter vidya gaem, you pay for "research" as well, which is development time essentially.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?
What class do you recommend to play ? I don't wanna get bored.



I have some bad news.
I would say Embermage. Engineer could be fun too, but in most cases the easiest way is to build tanky character and spam 1-2 skills. I finished my own games with Engi in fact, but later try with Embermage was lot more fun.

You could try looking for custom class as well, but personally, I couldnt find any interesting one. 90% are based on mage characters, which is just lame.

Speaking of, anybody could suggest some interesting class similar to Assassin from D2? Or Druid?
are there any good mods for this yet


Endless Dungeon and Synergies are the first I could think of. A lot more awaits.
So, no good custom class yet?
How many coins did you spend?



a couple

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

Nah, by 2050 we'll have our conciousnesses in computers, living in a perfect matrix.
Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?
How can one company be so based?

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

If "If"s and "But"s were candy and nuts we all be jolly then!

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.





:(




More like memorizing responses.
I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.



No it isn't. Fuck off.
So whatever happened with that after credits scene?

It seems like it was retconned out of existence
I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?
How can one company be so based?

remember friends only PC users shitpost as shown by this wonderful poster

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.

I like all the stuff that related to the first game. The idea that it was replicating Solid Snake's challenges to train Raiden was very cool. However, I'd argue that all of the world government conspiracy theory stuff is superfluous and the game wouldn't actually suffer at all from it not being there. It felt tacked on and had little relevance to Raiden's actions and experiences.

Some of it was pretty cool though.

that scene in itself is really a dead giveaway of what's going on

Snake just shows up out of thin air with all of Raiden's things(like he and by extension the player was expecting) in his iconic uniform, the cheat bandana and gives some grand speech with a ninja sword that allows Raiden to do Gray Fox moves. You stop and think about it it's so ridiculous given the context and convient combined with everything else happening in Arsonal onward, I mean for god's sake it looks just like the VR simulation and has those computer nodes popping up everywhere

Then why are we discussing MGS games on here?
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Yeah, I know that almost everywhere you go the majority of people will be very similar, but at least there would be more hobby shops, maybe some drawfags, or musicians that play ska, prog rock or whatever.

I know you guys have been having a real blast assuming that I'm "that kid" from your highschool, but really, I'm just tired of hanging out with people that I don't find fun, and I have no drive to change the way I look or act for those people, since the people I do enjoy hanging out with don't care how I look, and its generally just very refreshing to hang out with people with unique personalities anyway.

Its actually kind of odd, on some levels, that /v/ of all places is so quick to get riled up over some dude caring more about playing vidya than getting a hair cut, getting a gf or whatever

Just finished this. The story was complete bullshit.
Why is this praised again?
It's just some cheesy conspiracy theory (which is retarded in itself), masked to appear deep. And at the end of the game the avalanche of bullshit reaches critical mass and the story just falls apart, like it's some kind of stoner MGS fanfiction.
MGS1 wasn't a masterpiece, it was cheesy, but it was at least passable. This one, however, is fucking retarded.

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
How the fuck do I kill Plantera? Is the only easy way to lure it to the surface?

I have turtle armor and have been dropping it to about 12k with light discs.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts








Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

You've got to admire her ambition, despite the fact that the ambition is to spread her cover all forms of gaming with a thick plastic covering of political correctness.



The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.

Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Protip: You can't.


mfw noone says grimrock

i fucking

grimrock


Everyone knows RPGs are a myth.

i know right
why no grimrock threads
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.

lol mustard race. When are you going to ketchup to consoles?
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?
What I wanna know is, if there's a single person on /v/ with the Star Ocean 4 International platinum trophy.

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming


the minimum system requirements for cod:ghosts








Holy smokes, my Skyrim folder with loadsa mods(150+) and high res textures is only 25 gigs


But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.

CoD single player is my guilty pleasure. It's so cheesy it's good.

Pirate always, of course.
How can one company be so based?

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes





main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Protip: You can't.


mfw noone says grimrock

i fucking

grimrock


Everyone knows RPGs are a myth.

i know right
why no grimrock threads
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.

lol mustard race. When are you going to ketchup to consoles?
How can one company be so based?

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes





main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

Hey /v/, try and name a better RPG than Dark Souls that was released within the last 5 years.

Protip: You can't.


mfw noone says grimrock

i fucking

grimrock


Everyone knows RPGs are a myth.

i know right
why no grimrock threads
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

I never said it was bad. Personally, however, most games just turned into "protect what ever the opposing team wants to destroy/take and let the timer run out" matches. Essentially turning every game into a deathmatch.

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.

lol mustard race. When are you going to ketchup to consoles?
How can one company be so based?

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes





main story is only 3 hours long


Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?


/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?
I've been seeing this shit for a while now. Is it actually decent or are people just playing it for the sake of being able to say they played it? Cause it looks like shit.

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
How the fuck do I kill Plantera? Is the only easy way to lure it to the surface?

I have turtle armor and have been dropping it to about 12k with light discs.

You've got to admire her ambition, despite the fact that the ambition is to spread her cover all forms of gaming with a thick plastic covering of political correctness.



The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

It's 70% exploration and boss killing 30% building shit, if you don't like building you can get away with wooden rectangles and spend the saved time on more exploration.


Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

You've got to admire her ambition, despite the fact that the ambition is to spread her cover all forms of gaming with a thick plastic covering of political correctness.



The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

Who cares, I love reading books like Neuromancer in the train or wherever. I personally can't wait.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4t-

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.
Gun jamming would make games rely more on teamwork.

Doesn't really matter how often it's in there. Borderland 2 might not have much either but on /v/ that game is hated. A Nintendo game does it and that's perfectly fine.

Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

The Third Reich’s answer to the British MBW is fully committed to a fearsome anti-armour role. Loud and lumbering, this behemoth crashes through the underbrush with its mere presence instilling dread in enemy tank crews. While proving highly effective against American Shermans, and the Soviet KV-1s and T-34s, it's lack of speed and maneuverability made it desperately vulnerable to anti-tank infantry.

You can't seriously expect that kind of quality from video game tie in books.

Think of Warcraft and 40k novels if you want to know what the books will be like.

Personally I think that spreading shit out makes the main game (or the series) no longer a stand alone packet. Instead of you are supposed to find all kinds of low quality shit that isn't even available in most places where the game is. Even it isn't strictly necessary for the game experience it still diminishes its value.

Never read a vidya book before.

I don't know if that's completely fair. The author is far more indicative of quality than the franchise. I've always heard the Halo books were good, and I know there are more than a few 40k books that are decent in their own right. The first few novels of the Horus Heresy read like a crazy fever-dream opera and stuff like Dead Men Walking show that the stories can be character-driven.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?

Not only that, i'd add irrelevant, a shill, worthless and hack to that.

Have some standards you nigger. I could land a fucking plane on that nose, and I'm not even a pilot.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
ALL THESE CONSOLEFAGS TEARS

How can one company be so based?

no it's set in modern day manhattan

OFFICIAL /v/ SOUNDTRACK NOSTALGIA THREAD

My addition will be in the first reply

This soundtrack really takes me back

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHMP


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ni1
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.




wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.



i don't care what other thinks i am delusional one motherfucker
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.

Shoulda had Gran Tuirsmo 5 and Cross Edge too just to keep things consistent

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.

oh I see
Was this translated by the ace attorney team?

Sony E3 2006, the Giant Enemy Crab game during the demo had the dev saying "hit it's weakpoint for massive damage."

Diamond and Pearl had quite a few instances of old Something Awful memes in the game's dialogue because the translator was a goon.




Doesn't really matter how often it's in there. Borderland 2 might not have much either but on /v/ that game is hated. A Nintendo game does it and that's perfectly fine. Like I said, it's not a coincidence and pretty damning proof that this board has a massive Nintendo bias and will excuse anything Nintendo does.

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?

Not only that, i'd add irrelevant, a shill, worthless and hack to that.

Have some standards you nigger. I could land a fucking plane on that nose, and I'm not even a pilot.
Ignore the sloppiness and set sail for disappointment.

First row revealed soon.


Normally, I'd pick B, but I have a good feeling about D.

I still have so much shit to play on the 3ds
Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.
Is it hacked yet?

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
ALL THESE CONSOLEFAGS TEARS

THEY ARE DELICIOUS.

I DEMAND MORE!!!!




wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.


+1 feat






Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.



i don't care what other thinks i am delusional one motherfucker
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.

Jesus christ
Shoulda had Gran Tuirsmo 5 and Cross Edge too just to keep things consistent
Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

why

le


oh I see
Was this translated by the ace attorney team?

Sony E3 2006, the Giant Enemy Crab game during the demo had the dev saying "hit it's weakpoint for massive damage."

Diamond and Pearl had quite a few instances of old Something Awful memes in the game's dialogue because the translator was a goon.




Doesn't really matter how often it's in there. Borderland 2 might not have much either but on /v/ that game is hated. A Nintendo game does it and that's perfectly fine. Like I said, it's not a coincidence and pretty damning proof that this board has a massive Nintendo bias and will excuse anything Nintendo does.

There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.
ALL THESE CONSOLEFAGS TEARS

THEY ARE DELICIOUS.

I DEMAND MORE!!!!
How can one company be so based?

no it's set in modern day manhattan


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.

OFFICIAL /v/ SOUNDTRACK NOSTALGIA THREAD

My addition will be in the first reply

This soundtrack really takes me back

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHMP

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.




wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.


+1 feat






Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.



i don't care what other thinks i am delusional one motherfucker
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.

Jesus christ
Shoulda had Gran Tuirsmo 5 and Cross Edge too just to keep things consistent
Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

No, are you retarded?

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.
Is it hacked yet?

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?

Doesn't really matter how often it's in there. Borderland 2 might not have much either but on /v/ that game is hated. A Nintendo game does it and that's perfectly fine.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.
Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub
why

le


oh I see
Was this translated by the ace attorney team?

Sony E3 2006, the Giant Enemy Crab game during the demo had the dev saying "hit it's weakpoint for massive damage."

Diamond and Pearl had quite a few instances of old Something Awful memes in the game's dialogue because the translator was a goon.




Doesn't really matter how often it's in there. Borderland 2 might not have much either but on /v/ that game is hated. A Nintendo game does it and that's perfectly fine. Like I said, it's not a coincidence and pretty damning proof that this board has a massive Nintendo bias and will excuse anything Nintendo does.



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.



i don't care what other thinks i am delusional one motherfucker
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.

Jesus christ
Shoulda had Gran Tuirsmo 5 and Cross Edge too just to keep things consistent

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

They're already stuck in their wageslave economy and classist system. Just look at the posts in this thread. NO-ONE can imagine a society where money doesn't exist. Every response to that idea consists of "but why would anyone work without money?". They're so stuck in this wageslave society mold, that they can't even FATHOM a more advanced society.

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.

I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.
Is it hacked yet?

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

So John Carmack is poor and stupid.



Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?

Not only that, i'd add irrelevant, a shill, worthless and hack to that.

Have some standards you nigger. I could land a fucking plane on that nose, and I'm not even a pilot.
Ignore the sloppiness and set sail for disappointment.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

His drug dealer parents, who have MYSTERIOIUSLY vanished

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.
Is it hacked yet?

you can call me PINGUM OF D00M ;]




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.
are there any games where you get to fight god?


Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW?



All those level 50's, lost, in time, like, tears... in rain...


Pretentious? This isn't a film student, this is fucking Ridley Scott. Bladerunner aside, Alien is a fucking 10/10 movie purely based on direction alone. There really can't be any sign of pretentiousness if you've got the talent to back it up. You're gonna have to cite a moment where it had its head in its ass or I'm not gonna be able to believe you. That, or you don't know what words mean.

That means nothing for quality. That description fits 2001:a space odyssey to a T yet it's easily one of the greatest movies ever (let's not argue about that.) Basically: scenes that are predictable and long don't necessarily make a movie shit

Yeah, Ford's a shitty actor. Still, it's kind of half the point that the "human" characters are less human than the fucking robots. It's really only stereotypical because there've been like thirty years between today and it's release that you assume. It was pretty cutting edge for the time, maybe not for sci-fi in general, but certainly film. Star Wars certainly did NOT have these kind of themes or motifs or even subject matter.

There's more to a movie's visual effects than CGI bro. Hell, the only reason I still love A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back is the visual effects.


The author of the book Blade Runner was based on was pretty openly opposed to the idea of the question of Deckard being a replicant, and that that was in no way a part of the story




you were assuming that my post was titled "ANON'S OVERARCHING CRITIQUE OF THIS FILM AS A WHOLE" because I was talking about plot, and you moved on the assumption that it was my only critique of the film because it was all that I was talking about.

As a whole, I thought it was poorly paced.

Does it really matter? It was a good film either way.

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".

why are the gta5 cars so shitty? they even ruined the pheonix for fucks sake.

Yep, but in GTA, I wear it proudly like a badge.

Also, I drive them off into water if I'm able to drive them. I don't think that counts.
I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

What apartment is good? Doesn't have to be the highest end one. I just want a multi-car garage and somewhere that doesn't look like a Mexican whorehouse.

Also, all houses come with TVs right? Can I put a bounty on a player and watch them try and survive the hordes of players who descend upon them?

I also drive them up to the fuel tanks scattered around, and shoot those instead. It's pretty fucking stupid that they discipline you for using game mechanics as intended.




wrong.

humans have inhibitory mechanisms on muscle activity.

if you actually used your muscles to full capacity, you'd be just as strong as any other ape, except your muscles would be prone to tearing and rupturing.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware



Que? Am I in for a ruse cruise?

Anyway, Etrian odyssey, Fire emblem, Kid icarus uprising, Monster hunter, Professor layton, VLR, and if you haven't owned a DS before then there are other vidya like Ghost trick, ace attorney games, Hotel dusk.






Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub



Do games still do this?









Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

No, are you retarded?

Are you this dense?

Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?

Not only that, i'd add irrelevant, a shill, worthless and hack to that.

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Can't be fucking arsed for cartoony shit.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.

Nerds know their shit and are socially retarded
Geeks don't know shit and are socially retarded.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

I want to get an apartment before I buy a customize a car.

I also drive them up to the fuel tanks scattered around, and shoot those instead. It's pretty fucking stupid that they discipline you for using game mechanics as intended.

Nintendo you fucking retards the Wii U is hitting the shitter because you guys aren't bringing out the big guns. I don't want Mario Land for the Wii U I want a REAL Mario game like 64, Sunshine and Galaxy. And as for Windwaker HD, Nooooo Nintendo give us a new Zelda game, are you guys getting lazy or what?
go back to youtube


I agree with you on Mario, but come on. Zelda games take time to make, and they deliberately said that WWHD was a holdover to satisfy people until new Zelda is finished.


Pretty much, yup. What big launch titles did they have? ANOTHER NSMB game and a mini-game compilation?

New Zelda and Mario? Have this enchanced port and a 3D Land sequel a year after release.
If you read or watch reviews where do you go? Who do you think gives the best reviews?

/v/ and metacritic? Why don't you safe your time and skip right to the videos?

You buy games without knowing what the gameplay is like? If anything, this should be your top priority.

didn't mean to reply
/v/ is much much too harsh towards certain games and the professional reviewers are much much too lenient towards all games so I usually check metacritic, snoop around /v/ for a little, and then try to extrapolate some kind of median truth




Like what? I've always been able to get both sides from /v/. The only time I've seen /v/ run an actual train of misinformation about a game was Fez.



If the point is to get an accurate view of the game, I find /v/ to be the best. Doesn't matter if 90% of it is bullshit if I can get what I need.



WHERE THE FUCK IS THE BASTION OST

it's on the list fag


So they don't know anything about music, in much the same way that /v/ knows nothing about video games and /a/ knows nothing about anime.



i don't care what other thinks i am delusional one motherfucker
Is there any word on any differences with the trophy system on PS4?

Also, what is the hardest Platinum trophy you have?

I think I saw a guy on here once with plats for SO4 and both Disgaea 3 and 4

rip

this. I have...2 platinums? but they weren't difficult by any stretch.

There are just far too many games, and my backlog is way too full, to spent countless hours doing bullshit collection quests and the like for the sake of a "trophy"
Not hard but the plat for the dbz hd collection, the stupid luck based break ins were tedious as fuck but you had to keep playing to unlock certain characters.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.

That's not Wind Waker or Okami.

HOW DO YOU FUCKING COUNTER THIS FUCKING CUNT?
WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA?

That looks likes the map from the new game that is supposed to be even more casual than LoL.
Can't recall the name of the game though.

He breaks the mana inside his body to move quickly between two points. He's a monk, not a spellcaster.

The demo was on Newgrounds. Its tremendous success was what prompted Edmund to not make the game free to play in the first place.

Better luck next time.

I honestly don't know who you're criticizing
Wait Boi is getting a remake? Wtf?


Jesus wept you're late, it was announced last year even, won't be flash based and is built from the ground up with even more new shit in it.


Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Call of Duty has an objectives list.
How can one company be so based?

Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

"I will say nothing at all but write as much as I can"













gtfo you relativistic scum.


I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

Don't really have a lot of AoS pictures, so here's a screenshot from yesterday when we actually managed to fill the server.



What happened? I just left.


John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Can't be fucking arsed for cartoony shit.

I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.
I'm Looking for people to regularly play DotA 2 pubs with. I've been playing off and on for some years now but can't be arsed to get matched with (shitty) brs anymore.

It would be great if you were 20+ and didn't get mad too easily. I myself am 23 and in my final semestre of university.

You'd better believe me!


stop naruto STOP

i don't want to believe anymore








We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

Are you this dense?

He's trying to tell a joke.
It's not very funny.

lol mustard race. When are you going to ketchup to consoles?
That's not Wind Waker or Okami.

He was? What was the punchline?










Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.



What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Call of Duty has an objectives list.
How can one company be so based?






Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

"I will say nothing at all but write as much as I can"













gtfo you relativistic scum.


I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

I usually hear sheltered suburban white faggots trying to act gangster. I know they're white by their voice/accent.

What happened? I just left.


John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Can't be fucking arsed for cartoony shit.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.

Nerds know their shit and are socially retarded
Geeks don't know shit and are socially retarded.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".
How can one company be so based?


Comics came out in the 80s, game is based just before the comics. None of this Neo-80s bs.

Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Call of Duty has an objectives list.



You disgust me













gtfo you relativistic scum.


I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.










Never played or loaded the save file again.
Haven't even spoiled the full ending or fight yet.

You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.


Dude, have you played Kid Icarus Uprising? His games are all filled with detail, love and INFINITE content. He deserves my total respect as a developer.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.

You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Go back to protesting on Wall Street, hippie.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Get both, no reason to just own 2.5 and 1.5 is gonna drop in price anyway.


My computer's a piece of shit.



I probably will eventually. Main reason I didn't get it was because I still have the original for the PS2 but knowing my luck it's scratched to fuck and back by now.

My computer is a piece of shit too but Ican run BBS FM really well.
PPSSPP is probably the most stable emulator there ever was.

PPSSPP is able to run on smartphones and not new smartphones either. I think it can run on your computer. Try it out.


I still own the original releases of KH, KHII, and Re:CoM for my PS2. Yet I still bought the 1.5. I WILL be getting 2.5 as well, but that's because my copy of II is a bit scratched and won't go past a certain point.
The last vidya character you played as has to go up against Crixus in a duel to the death.

Bear in mind, Naevia has just been kidnapped and Spartacus has won the championship.

How do they fare?

Not well, I imagine.
Spartacus is a show for plebs.

Like, literal plebs or uncultured people?

Uncultured people clearly. By the original meaning of "plebs" everyone alive would be a "pleb".

Maybe the fact that I've had actual sex has something to do with it.
Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.






I hate myself.

pleb

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

In no order

Saints Row 2
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (GameCube)
Okami
Viewtiful Joe
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate
Counter Strike
DOOM
Metal Gear Rising
Jet Set Radio
Dark Cloud


Katawa Shoujo.

are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Why do grills love Mortal Kombat so much?

Unless you're increasing the resistance you wouldn't gain any muscle. Trust me on this.

nigga thats gay




Nerds know their shit and are socially retarded
Geeks don't know shit and are socially retarded.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
Hi,

I need a computer game that i can play on my laptop using trackpad as mouse, while laying back in my bed. Any suggestions?
League of Legends
Smokers and stoners are the same thing.
Western Female Models General



Ew
Why is it so hard for western artists to not draw a manface on every girl?

TIme to fap.

It's funny how this is the only arguments people can complain on when it comes to western style



Show me a woman without a jaw

I used to do that

Now it just makes me laugh at how mouthbreather-like and silly it is typing that out.

I tried it a couple of days ago for the first time in years, it felt fucking awkward (no pun intended).

Maybe the fact that I've had actual sex has something to do with it.
Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.






I hate myself.

pleb

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

In no order

Saints Row 2
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (GameCube)
Okami
Viewtiful Joe
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate
Counter Strike
DOOM
Metal Gear Rising
Jet Set Radio
Dark Cloud


Katawa Shoujo.
How can one company be so based?
Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.


that was so cheezy and amazing
are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

"I will say nothing at all but write as much as I can"


Jesus christ think a little before you post.




What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Call of Duty has an objectives list.



You disgust me













gtfo you relativistic scum.


I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

I usually hear sheltered suburban white faggots trying to act gangster. I know they're white by their voice/accent.
now either I've to be super rich or leave gaming

But what if it isn't overhyped? What if its actually

Nobody thinks these are expensive parts. Read before you post retard.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.

Most of my SF4 time was at my local arcade, but you get the idea.
I'll admit I haven't played much SvC2

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

What games DON'T do this?



You got what you deserved. Why wouldn't you just finish some quests before you got more quest items?

Call of Duty has an objectives list.



You disgust me













gtfo you relativistic scum.


I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

I usually hear sheltered suburban white faggots trying to act gangster. I know they're white by their voice/accent.

John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Can't be fucking arsed for cartoony shit.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.
How can one company be so based?
Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.

Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Maybe the fact that I've had actual sex has something to do with it.
Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.






I hate myself.

pleb

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

In no order

Saints Row 2
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (GameCube)
Okami
Viewtiful Joe
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate
Counter Strike
DOOM
Metal Gear Rising
Jet Set Radio
Dark Cloud


Katawa Shoujo.
How can one company be so based?
Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.


that was so cheezy and amazing
are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Now it just makes me laugh at how mouthbreather-like and silly it is typing that out.

I tried it a couple of days ago for the first time in years, it felt fucking awkward (no pun intended).

Maybe the fact that I've had actual sex has something to do with it.
Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.






I hate myself.

pleb

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

In no order

Saints Row 2
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (GameCube)

Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.

are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

I don't get it /v/... Why does NO ONE EVER WANT TO DO MISSIONS ONLINE?! It seems like everyone just wants to rob snack stores instead of actually doing missions.. Or constantly trying to penetrate the army base or whatever and get shot by tanks.

Why does no one ever want to do missions? Why is it so hard to find people who want to do shit besides drive around and get killed?

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

I usually hear sheltered suburban white faggots trying to act gangster. I know they're white by their voice/accent.

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

Why haven't you played Persona 5 yet?

It's great in an unintentionally hilarious way.

hes too busy making smoothies and trying to talk to Haze to care

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

Hello shit nuggets,

I've been thinking about getting a 3DS for dat derre pookyman, the thing that's keeping me from doing do is that I don't really see a gud games for it. Can you shit lords recommend something gud

Inb4 Mario rehashes and other shovelware
Anyone who buys a Nintendo Handheld in the last two generations should know that racing, sports, and fps really died last gen and never returned. Barring of course the Nintendo-first party titles of racing (Mario Kart) and FPS (Metroid); almost all the rest were awful.

Its Die J?den not Das Juden - whoever made that pic is retarded

you picked the wrong gaming platform, bub

3DS camera isn't that bad, but it does take some time to get used to. If lack of online doesn't concern you, but you still are skeptical, I would either jump in regardless, since that's what I did for 3 Ultimate, or wait for a price drop. It was on sale on the eShop a while ago for $20.


You just said "don't expect too many third party on that shit". Nothing about whether they will be worthwhile. There's no way of know if any games are going to be worthwhile this early in the game. You're still taking a big chance.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

FUCK!



have fun getting banned/reset by Jewstar
Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

Rockstar fucked up by hiding everything behind EXP and microtransaction walls. Glad we're getting the $500 grand so I can actually have fun.



Get a friend, have them do the glitch with you on invite only server. Once you both have 20 million in "carrying cash" (don't deposit it), sign into server with new character, kill your friend with 20 million and take his 20 million. Sign into server with your old character with your glitched money, have friend kill you so he can take your money.

Your money is now protected from the coming wipe.

John Rambo wannabe

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Can't be fucking arsed for cartoony shit.

Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.

Not enough waifus

What should the next Zelda game be about?
In which timeline should it take place?
Which previous Zelda game should it take it's inspiration from, if any?
What gameplay ideas would you like to see implemented/scrapped?

For me, I think the best course would be to continue on from Spirit Tracks. I'd like to see a Zelda game set in a new world without a triforce or any of the old lore holding it back.
The Legend of Zelda: Shield of *whatever*
Spiritual remake of the original. Blasted, desertified Hyrule some time after an unknown apocalyptic event. You start the game as a Link who has been raised entirely in a sheltered cave system, only recently beginning to rarely venture out with his father (presumably adoptive, the only other human Link has ever known) on hunting expeditions. It is on own of these expeditions that your father is struck down by a new strange form of beast, and your adventure begins.

the titular shield is the focus rather than the weapon. the weapon can be any one of a multitude of generic disposable alternatives, each with totally different function (think Zeno Clash). z-targeting mode is now expanded into a whole different game mode, when active you have 1:1 control of your shield and weapon (with wiimote+). the shield is critical because it is the mechanism for all magic in the game (using the touchscreen in a number of different ways, from drawing runes to manipulating 'vortex' puzzles to rearranging objects in a screen capture), which returns in force and greatly expanded from anything any past Zelda has done. This Link is a wizard.

stone-age aesthetic in an art style using relatively photorealistic modelling but with vibrant matte coloration and special particle-based lighting which enables shadows to 'crawl'.
Next Zelda game should bring anoukies back.

What if Link doesn't see that Ganondorf is in a downward spiral of evil and goes along with him until some point where Link sees that he's gone too far then the game really begins
Hope they take the art style from Twillight princess, One of the best looking Zelda games but shame about everything else.

Hey /v/. I've been sick all my life, but about a month ago I learned that I was seriously ill. I found out on Saturday that I'm going to die in about a year.

List off the best video games you've ever played--not the ones that everyone tells you are good, but the ones that brought you happiness, fulfillment, and joy in your life. Gaming has been the biggest part of my life and I will be playing my favorite games back to back to back. I'm not sure exactly what order I'll be going in, but I plan on starting in the NES era and working my way up to modern games, and playing various series chronologically.

Infinite is only good if you can stand dull generic gameplay and the concept of hypertime.

Basically, only if you're an idiot.






I hate myself.

pleb

Damn anon. If I were you aside from playing video games I would try to make peace with everyone. That's just me though. I'll give you a list of games that made me happy. Not depressing games, fun ones. On the bright side, you'll know peace from the world's true evil.

In no order

Saints Row 2
Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles (GameCube)
Okami
Viewtiful Joe
Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate
Counter Strike
DOOM
Metal Gear Rising
Jet Set Radio
Dark Cloud


Katawa Shoujo.
How can one company be so based?
Should I play this? I kinda liked TWD


Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.


that was so cheezy and amazing
are there any games where you get to fight god?

Lots of Shin Megami Tensei games, Final Fantasy X, I think Xenogears?
Silent Hill 3

OP made the mistake of creating a thread with an image more interesting than the topic itself.

What did you expect?



There are countless religions, along with many ideas of what "god" and the "soul" are. Hell, even Christianity is divided as fuck when it comes to interpreting it's religious centerpiece.

It's okay to use the bible as a guide. But if you're taking information from a single source, then you're as ignorant as it gets.

What? Atheism is just the absence of belief. It's not fighting against anything, and the people that are are doing it wrong.
Personally I'm open to the idea of there being a creator who ultimately lead to the creation of the universe, but I think it's very improbable that it's any single one from a human religion, or even one that can affect the universe at all. One of the things I like to consider is that the universe was a side-effect of some minor action a being in a higher universe took, though that's not really something I "believe"

But that isn't an inherently religious thing. Humans are not "hardwired for belief". Religion only exhibits such quantities because
a) it fosters a sense of community and belonging, something that people really do need. (being a furry or brony has the same effect)
b) it brings people the comfort of not having to ask hard questions. Why did little Timmy get raped and murdered by the pedophile? What do we do now that he managed to get away with the crime because the police couldn't track him down? Don't worry! God loved Timmy like he loves all of us (except the pedophile and gay people, they're both going to hell.) but he just works in mysterious ways!
You can make an argument for religion being of value to a community, but this isn't an inherent function of the concept of religion, just religious organizations.

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

Because most people who want to play GTA want to fuck around, not do shitty Old Republic-tier "story" missions.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

I was in a guild in EU-Kilrogg once where the leader and co-leader were husband and wife, they met on WoW and live together; the girl was from the UK and the guy was from Sweden.
Is it hacked yet?




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.
/v/, who's your waifu and why is it aqua?

He is overweight, happy, plays vidya, has a girlfriend that you probably wouldn't have wanted to date anyway, and he has a pet owl,

He seems like a pretty cool guy

We all are fucking shit, but for the love of god we are not nearly as self-deluded as this guy.




Why?

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

it's a problem with the crack, there's a crackfix, but it's nearly impossible to find.
i have it, but you don't deserve it now.

you just told him you stupid lying fuck.
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
How the fuck do I kill Plantera? Is the only easy way to lure it to the surface?

Where's Star Citizen? Still selling DLC before the game is out or even in beta?

Where is 3.3? Half of 3.3.? Anything?

MN9 is being sold to Capcom after getting funded?

Neal Stephenson's amazing sword game's development stopped, funds gone.

Anything else?

Not only that, i'd add irrelevant, a shill, worthless and hack to that.

He is overweight, happy, plays vidya, has a girlfriend that you probably wouldn't have wanted to date anyway, and he has a pet owl,

He seems like a pretty cool guy

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.

Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.


More like
A design flaw OP. If one misses, every attack on that enemy misses as well.

STRATEGY!


OP scenario is a known mechanic flaw. It's being looked at for the new expansion. As is the Panic stupidity.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

That's some vile insecurity you've got going there.
It's not the game's fault you're not a cool artist with lots of friends.

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

it's a problem with the crack, there's a crackfix, but it's nearly impossible to find.
i have it, but you don't deserve it now.

you just told him you stupid lying fuck.

you faggot

What? I don't even understand what you find punchable about that guy

He is overweight, happy, plays vidya, has a girlfriend that you probably wouldn't have wanted to date anyway, and he has a pet owl,

He seems like a pretty cool guy

We all are fucking shit, but for the love of god we are not nearly as self-deluded as this guy.


I was in a guild in EU-Kilrogg once where the leader and co-leader were husband and wife, they met on WoW and live together; the girl was from the UK and the guy was from Sweden.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

it's a problem with the crack, there's a crackfix, but it's nearly impossible to find.
i have it, but you don't deserve it now.

you just told him you stupid lying fuck.

sadly i did buy it.
are you honestly amazed that someone bought a pc game? or do you find it hard to beleive a company would release a pc game that didn't work properly?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?



WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TEXT

WHY IS THERE SO MUCH JUSTIFICATION



you faggot

What? I don't even understand what you find punchable about that guy

He is overweight, happy, plays vidya, has a girlfriend that you probably wouldn't have wanted to date anyway, and he has a pet owl,

He seems like a pretty cool guy

We all are fucking shit, but for the love of god we are not nearly as self-deluded as this guy.


I was in a guild in EU-Kilrogg once where the leader and co-leader were husband and wife, they met on WoW and live together; the girl was from the UK and the guy was from Sweden.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on.

If i do not already have the 3ds for x and y, should I buy the 2DS or is it just complete shit?


This bothers me greatly.

But the 3DS XL screen is just SO much bigger.
I'm not a rich fag but I think it'll annoy me if I'd get a 2DS.


It's an English word you know. Mushy means mushy. You'd be retarded if you don't know what I'm saying, also if you'd disagree since multiple reviews said that.

Bullshit. 360 is shit because, once again, it's mushy and imprecise. 3DS is a bit stiff at the worst, but it's precise. Nothing alike.

i had a regular 3DS for a year before i bought my XL, neither of them ever developed scratching and i never used any intermediary between the top screen and the borders of the bottom screen. if i recall correctly that was either a problem in early models or just a widely overblown smudging issue that people confused for scratches.
paying an extra £50 just for 3D seems like a really shit deal.

3DS XL for best over all imo (only because of clam shell design)
2DS if you don't give a shit about 3D.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.


The third time it played during the stream.

Show me a woman without a jaw


There's a difference.
If i do not already have the 3ds for x and y, should I buy the 2DS or is it just complete shit?


This bothers me greatly.

But the 3DS XL screen is just SO much bigger.
I'm not a rich fag but I think it'll annoy me if I'd get a 2DS.


It's an English word you know. Mushy means mushy. You'd be retarded if you don't know what I'm saying, also if you'd disagree since multiple reviews said that.

Bullshit. 360 is shit because, once again, it's mushy and imprecise. 3DS is a bit stiff at the worst, but it's precise. Nothing alike.

i had a regular 3DS for a year before i bought my XL, neither of them ever developed scratching and i never used any intermediary between the top screen and the borders of the bottom screen. if i recall correctly that was either a problem in early models or just a widely overblown smudging issue that people confused for scratches.
paying an extra £50 just for 3D seems like a really shit deal.

3DS XL for best over all imo (only because of clam shell design)
2DS if you don't give a shit about 3D.

Oh, sorry. Terraria is different in almost every aspect from Minecraft, though. And also has double/triple the content of Minecraft.


Oh, so this is less building than minecraft, but I can get very idiotic with that feature if i want? And it has bosses and such too?

I may want this instead
How the fuck do I kill Plantera? Is the only easy way to lure it to the surface?

I have turtle armor and have been dropping it to about 12k with light discs.

Find a fairly open area in the jungle or make one yourself with dynamite.

Don't give up and try using other weapons instead

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it.

It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.

It's more enjoyable being part of the stream than actually playing it yourself. It's like Rocky Horror in that way.

It's just watching someone play it and laughing at how terrible it is, really. It IS funny, that much I can tell you.

There's a difference.
If i do not already have the 3ds for x and y, should I buy the 2DS or is it just complete shit?


This bothers me greatly.

But the 3DS XL screen is just SO much bigger.
I'm not a rich fag but I think it'll annoy me if I'd get a 2DS.


It's an English word you know. Mushy means mushy. You'd be retarded if you don't know what I'm saying, also if you'd disagree since multiple reviews said that.

Bullshit. 360 is shit because, once again, it's mushy and imprecise. 3DS is a bit stiff at the worst, but it's precise. Nothing alike.

i had a regular 3DS for a year before i bought my XL, neither of them ever developed scratching and i never used any intermediary between the top screen and the borders of the bottom screen. if i recall correctly that was either a problem in early models or just a widely overblown smudging issue that people confused for scratches.
paying an extra £50 just for 3D seems like a really shit deal.

3DS XL for best over all imo (only because of clam shell design)
2DS if you don't give a shit about 3D.

The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

Use the catalog, we already have a thread






This is the enthusiast, non-misogynist, non-entitled discussion.


You seem mad. Consider the other partner in this venture, a well respected lead game-dev, who was also "fired".
I'm not listening to 16 minutes of that...


It's a shame Lightning will shit up the game.

Yes

No, Beyond deserves the shit its getting, the writing is fucking terrible.

I like it better than TWD so far.

Are you going to buy or pirate the PC version of GTAV?

Despite the fact that there hasn't been proof that there piracy has kept a game from profiting

And you still have not provided any argument as to why anyone would work without money.
I worked for a vidya company for a while and piracy was less frowned upon than you might think. Most of us bought a shitload of games and related merchandise, being gamers with jobs and all that. But EVERYBODY also had a huge collection of pirated copies because there's only so much you can actually spend money on and if you're working in the field you are curious about your competition and sometimes there are no playable demos.

There will always be pirates and the vast majority of those would never buy your game in the first place, at least not at the current point. But they can still become a benefit for the community, for example by creating maps and mods and thus extending the shelf life of the product.

Elaborate copy protection mechanisms or this "new" drm shit where you have to be online to play a fucking single player game will only piss off customers. Instead make games that people really want to play and that makes them want to support the creators. Look at Dwarf Fortress, Toady is living quite comfortably off donations and it's been over a year since the last update.

That shit happens all the time. I'll give you a few examples:
"Here's your birthday gift! A New Car!"
"You just one a free car!"
Notice how none of these are illegal either.
So yea, it seems okay.



You liberal arts children are adorable.





Nerds know their shit and are socially retarded
Geeks don't know shit and are socially retarded.


I used to do that

Now it just makes me laugh at how mouthbreather-like and silly it is typing that out.

I tried it a couple of days ago for the first time in years, it felt fucking awkward (no pun intended).

Maybe the fact that I've had actual sex has something to do with it.

no, but they can stab you with their bra wires

He grips it harder and harder each time.




You know the roster is going to be shit when they won't even reveal Jigglypuff. And don't give me any of that "original 8" shit, they already revealed Luigi.

smash is the right mix of casual and hardcore to get everyone to buy itq

I did. The controls were shitty. I don't care how witty and campy the dialogue is, if the game controls like shit, it's shit. And yes, control is the most important aspect of games. How can you acknowledge and absorb the content if the control is flawed? The fact that that stand came with the damn game is proof that he knew the controls were shit.

But hey, I'm just one person expressing his dislike. If you liked it, fine and well.

"I will say nothing at all but write as much as I can"


Jesus christ think a little before you post.

your favorites are disgusting, stop implying that you like quake or are remotely good at it.

Dragon Age 2 is around the corner
A little background info for all of you who weren't here at the time: EA released a bioware game that cost them 200 million dollars to make and /v/ saw it as a challenge (challenge accepted) to wreck it like no tomorrow. We hate bioware after what they did to Dragon Age and Mass Effect (making them waifu sexsims like Witcher 2) so we "challenge accepted" that motherfucker and took it head on. After a couple of months the game was ruined by us and they were forced to make it free to play.

Also we made an ex bioware employee lose his job.

Mission accomplished.

Blunderfags are the most cancerous fraction of this board, even worse than sonyggers.
Don't like a game? THEN DON'T FUCKING PLAY IT AND SPEND MONTHS DISCUSSING WHY YOU DON'T LIKE IT.










gtfo you relativistic scum.



So, they have weak muscle fibers then, because they can tear much more easily.
We all agree this was the best looking game of 6th gen right?

lol mustard race. When are you going to ketchup to consoles?
That's not Wind Waker or Okami.

He was? What was the punchline?
Ninja Gaiden
Star Fox: Adventures
Otogi
Halo 2, arguably

Xbox One. huehuehuehue




I actually really like this game, but I had a moment the other day that was maximum bullshit









Yeah but the nice thing about chess is how it doesn't rely on random chance. That's why people get asshurt in the first place.

6 missed overwatch shots happen in xcom. You're lucky that the overwatch shots don't fly off and damage shit like they did in the original games.

Just imagine how pissed you'd be if your soldiers overwatched a chryssalid that was right on top of your guys and they all managed to shoot eachother dead?

Panic didn't even need to fucking happen. One alien in a group of soldiers with half AP was a crossfire nightmare.


More like
A design flaw OP. If one misses, every attack on that enemy misses as well.

STRATEGY!


OP scenario is a known mechanic flaw. It's being looked at for the new expansion. As is the Panic stupidity.




yes yes, everyone knows strategy is about having high apm instead of making the best use of what little assets you have.


Why?


the game is 13 years old...

Someone saw this cover and thought: hey that would be pretty funny for my /v/ culture.
Pathetic.

it's a problem with the crack, there's a crackfix, but it's nearly impossible to find.
i have it, but you don't deserve it now.

you just told him you stupid lying fuck.

sadly i did buy it.
are you honestly amazed that someone bought a pc game? or do you find it hard to beleive a company would release a pc game that didn't work properly?
Do you know there are people out there who actually marry people they find over world of warcraft?



WHY IS THERE SO MUCH TEXT

WHY IS THERE SO MUCH JUSTIFICATION



you faggot

What? I don't even understand what you find punchable about that guy

He is overweight, happy, plays vidya, has a girlfriend that you probably wouldn't have wanted to date anyway, and he has a pet owl,

He seems like a pretty cool guy

We all are fucking shit, but for the love of god we are not nearly as self-deluded as this guy.


I was in a guild in EU-Kilrogg once where the leader and co-leader were husband and wife, they met on WoW and live together; the girl was from the UK and the guy was from Sweden.
Is it hacked yet?




The Vita can't ever beat the 3DS. This is just the reality you will have to accept.

Never mind that the two have completely different price points, but Monster Hunter 4 being 3DS exclusive (For now at least, if it will change because of Capcom's contract with Ninty expiring soon who knows) and completely outselling the Vita itself doesn't give much hope for it. It also doesn't help that Pokemon X and Y came out a while ago and Nintendo released a budget 3DS on top of that. It'll be harder for Sony than ever before, especially since all they announced recently as their biggest game is a port of Borderlands 2.

On a related note: How long until they hack this thing, realistically?

already done, although the thing cost twice as much as just buying a game. On a related note: why can't you mention one of the consoles without someone bringing up the other one on /v/?

Never because a courageous vanguard protects nintendo from any ner do wells. /r/ing that story about the kindhearted anon who got a 3DS test cartridge from nintendo by accident and how he gave it back and got a bag of goodies in return.
